How can you improve your communication and relationship with third-party software providers to stay informed about upcoming changes or updates?

To improve communication and relationship with the third-party software providers, I would conduct scheduled check-ins in which the team would discuss upcoming changes with the third-party software providers as well as conducting Q&As in order for both parties to stay informed.

I would also apply transparency and honesty. If the team ever encounters problems with, we communicate openly. This will cultivate a collaborative environment and will reduce problems encountered.
